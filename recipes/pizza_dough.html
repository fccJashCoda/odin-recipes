    <p>
      When it comes to making pizza, nothing comes close to fresh homemade pizza
      dough.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>.35oz active dry yeast</li>
      <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water (110째F, 44째C)</li>
      <li>350g(12oz) whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dissolve the yeast in warm water and add 2 tablespoons of honey. Let it
        rest for 5 minutes or until it forms a creamy layer of foam. Then add 3
        tablespoons of olive oil and stir.
      </li>
      <li>Put the flour in a large bowl and add a half tablespoon of salt.</li>
      <li>
        Pour half the water in the bowl, stirring until the dough pulls together
        and slowly add the remainder of water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the dough forms a nice solid mass, turn it out into a lightly
        floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly oil the mixing bowl and place the dough back into it, turning it
        around the bowl to coat it. Cover with a cloth and let it rise in a warm
        place for at least 2 hours. (Optionally, you can put it in the fridge if
        you want to let it rise a little more for up to 48 hours, making it
        extra airy)
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the dough has at least doubled in size, you can punch down the
        dough and turn it out into a lightly floured surface. Divide it into the
        desired amount of portions and shape your pizza.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the newly shaped pizza dough rest for 10 minutes before adding your
        toppings.
      </li>
      <li>Bake for 12 to 14 minutes at 220째C(425째F)</li>
      <li>Leftover dough can be frozen.</li>
    </ol>
